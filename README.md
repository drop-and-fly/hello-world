  a day in September.2021(I forget which day)
  Hi there!
  I'm a freshman in Central South University in CHina.I major in software engineering,the one I expected.
  I have only basic knowledge of C,html and computer science;I'm never gifted for programming or coding;My vocabulary size is no more than common level as a non-native speaker.But determined as I am,I believe I will do well in my major,or at least enjoy it.
  I registered GitHub as my after-class homework.I was told that it's a useful platform both for newcomers and experienced programmer and I'm not sure.What can GitHub teach me?What can I get from,and what can I do for GitHub?Who am I going to be?Actually,I feel ambivalent.
  Let it be.

  This is the second time (-(^W^)-) I come to Hub^=Git^=Hub^=Git.
  My college life have past 1/24 already.I am preparing for ACM,while learning C++ in a disordered but passionate way.Of course I know that,whether in talent or effort,many surpass me a lot,and that's why I begin working hard;but now,my passion of programming is really boosted.I spend 40 hours per week on programming and learning relevant knowledge and always try to keep the highest efficiency.I have programmed anti-Tic-Tac-Toe with different difficulty versions,a small tool to write html and CSS easilier,a rigorous designed calculator which will avoid any kind of input error(though with inadequate functions(-__-)\\) and have worked out twenty-five problems on VJudge.
  Admittedly,I will go farther and farther.
