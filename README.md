/*  
  Hi there!
  I'm a freshman in Central South University in CHina.I major in software engineering,the one I expected.
  I have only basic knowledge of C,html and computer science;I'm never gifted for programming or coding;My vocabulary size is no more than common level as a non-native speaker.But determined as I am,I believe I will do well in my major,or at least enjoy it.
  I registered GitHub as my after-class homework.I was told that it's a useful platform both for newcomers and experienced programmer and I'm not sure.What can GitHub teach me?What can I get from,and what can I do for GitHub?Who am I going to be?Actually,I feel ambivalent.
  Let it be.
